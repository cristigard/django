Django request/response process:
request from browser -> middleware -> view -> middleware -> response to browser 

#how to use middleware
1. create a file in app_name 'middleware.py' <- or other name

2a. add this function in middleware.py for function based:
def simple_middleware(get_response):
    # One-time configuration and initialization.
    def middleware(request):
        # Code to be executed for each request before
        # the view (and later middleware) are called.
        response = get_response(request)
        # Code to be executed for each request/response after
        # the view is called.
        return response
    return middleware
    
2b. or add this class in middleware.py for class based
class SimpleMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response
        # One-time configuration and initialization.
    def __call__(self, request):
        # Code to be executed for each request before
        # the view (and later middleware) are called.
        response = self.get_response(request)
        # Code to be executed for each request/response after
        # the view is called.
        return response
        
3a. add to settings.py middleware list (add last middleware in list!!!):
'app_name.middleware.simple_middleware' <- function based
 
3b. add to settings.py middleware list (add last middleware in list!!!):
'app_name.middleware.SimpleMiddleware' <- class based

Every time a request come from browser will execute simple_middleware or SimpleMiddleware
